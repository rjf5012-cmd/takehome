      This Privacy Policy explains how PaycheckTakeHome.com (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and protects
      information when you use our website located at <a href="https://paychecktakehome.com/">https://paychecktakehome.com/</a>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      PaycheckTakeHome.com is a simple calculator site. We do not require you to create an account or submit
      personal information such as your name, email address, or mailing address in order to use the Site.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage data</h3>
    <p>
      Like many websites, we may collect non-personal information automatically when you visit the Site, such as:

    <h3>Calculator inputs</h3>
    <p>
      The values you enter into the paycheck calculator (such as salary, hourly rate, or deductions) are used only
      in your browser to generate an estimate. We do not associate these inputs with your identity. In some cases,
      aggregated or anonymous usage information may be collected for analytics purposes (for example, to understand
      which features are used most).

      of analytics cookies via your browser settings or using tools provided by the analytics provider.
